/**
 * The Agent roster, read.
 *
 * Reads only. Writing an Agent is editing a file, and the desk has an editor
 * plane for that — a second write path for the same file is a second answer to
 * "what does this Agent say".
 *
 * Neither verb catches. A roster directory that exists and cannot be read
 * fails the call, naming the path and the reason, because a person can act on
 * that and cannot act on a roster that is quietly empty. One `AGENT.md` that
 * cannot be read or parsed is not a failure of the call: it arrives as an
 * entry with no definition and a problem saying why, and goes out as it came.

/**
 * The project a request named, held to the folders opened here.
 *
 * A project's Agents are read from beneath it, and `project` crossed a socket
 * the host trusts nothing from: unconfined, a request could have the host list
 * `.harnessdesk/agents` under any directory on the disk and read what is in it.
 * So it answers to the rule the git verbs answer to, `confineGitRoot`: an open
 * folder, or the top of the repository an open folder sits in. The second half
 * is not a courtesy — a project keeps its Agents at the top of its repository,
 * and a person who opened a subfolder of it still means that repository. Both
 * sides are compared as real paths, so a link inside an open folder does not
 * lead out of it, and what is read is the path the host answered, not the text
 * that arrived.
 *
 * A relative path is refused here rather than handed on: the host would resolve
 * it against wherever it happened to be started.
 *
 * `id` needs no such check while the roster matches it against its own listing
 * and never joins it onto a path. A roster that learned to open one Agent's
 * file directly would have to hold `id` to a single path segment first.
